This module was built to tackle the common but arduous problem of animating a list of items when the list's order changes.

DOM nodes can't actually reorder themselves; brand new nodes are created instead. Because of this, simple CSS transitions don't work.

Flip Move uses the [_FLIP technique_](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-flip-move/blob/master/docs/how-it-works.md) to work out what such a transition would look like, and fakes it using 60+ FPS hardware-accelerated CSS transforms.

## Installation

```
npm i -S react-flip-move
```

UMD builds are also available, in `/dist`.



## Features

Flip Move was inspired by Ryan Florence's awesome <a href="https://github.com/ryanflorence/react-magic-move" target="_blank">_Magic Move_</a>, and offers:

  * Full compatibility with React 0.14+. Will be maintained.

  * Exclusive use of hardware-accelerated CSS properties (`transform: translate`) instead of positioning properties (`top`, `left`). <a href="https://aerotwist.com/blog/pixels-are-expensive/" target="_blank">_Read why this matters_</a>.

  * Ability to 'humanize' transitions by staggering the delay and/or duration of subsequent elements.

  * Ability to provide `onStart` / `onFinish` callbacks.

  * Implementation based on the [_FLIP technique_](https://medium.com/developers-writing/animating-the-unanimatable-1346a5aab3cd), a beautiful-in-its-simplicity method of tackling this problem. UMD build, when minified and gzipped, is only 2kb! ⚡



## Quickstart

The implementation couldn't be simpler. Just wrap the items you'd like to move in a `FlipMove`, with any [custom options](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-flip-move#options):

```js
import FlipMove from 'react-flip-move';

class TopArticles extends Component {
  renderTopArticles() {
    return this.props.articles.map( article => <Article {...article} key={article.id} /> );
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="top-articles">
        <FlipMove easing="cubic-bezier(0, 0.7, 0.8, 0.1)">
          { this.renderTopArticles() }
        </FlipMove>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```



## Compatibility

## How It Works

Curious how this works, under the hood? [__Read the Medium post__](https://medium.com/@joshuawcomeau/animating-the-unanimatable-1346a5aab3cd).


## Enter/Leave animations

When items are created or removed, the original items will animate as you'd expect; they'll move out of the way when a new element is added, and slide to fill in the space when one is removed.

Adding proper enter/leave animations is a non-trivial task, so it is likely not going to be added in the near future. Contributors welcome! :)

        <li>The first element will take 200ms to transition.</li>
        <li>The second element will take 220ms to transition.</li>
        <li>The third element will take 240ms to transition.</li>
        <li>The fourth element will take 260ms to transition.</li>
      </ul>

      This effect is great for "humanizing" transitions and making them feel less robotic.

      These arguments are similar to the ones provided for <code>onFinish</code>, except we provide an <i>array</i> of the elements and nodes. The order of both arguments is guaranteed; this means you can use a zipping function like <a href="https://lodash.com/docs#zip">lodash's .zip</a> to get pairs of element/node, if needed.

## Gotchas

  * Does not work with stateless functional component children. This is because Flip Move uses refs to identify and apply styles to children, and stateless functional components cannot be given refs.

  * All children **need a unique `key` property**. Even if Flip Move is only given a single child, it needs to have a unique `key` prop for Flip Move to track it.

  * **Existing transition/transform properties will be overridden.** I am hoping to change this in a future version, but at present, Flip Move does not take into account existing `transition` or `transform` CSS properties on its direct children.

  * Elements whose positions have not changed between states will not be animated. This means that no `onStart` or `onFinish` callbacks will be executed for those elements.



## Note on 3D transforms and `will-change`

Many articles I've seen claim that in order to force browsers to use hardware acceleration, you need to resort to hacky fixes like `transformZ(0)` or use the new `will-change` property.

In my personal experimentations on modern versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox and IE, these properties offer little to no gain (in Chrome's timeline I saw a savings of ~0.5ms on a 24-item shuffle).

Applying `will-change` too willy-nilly can have an adverse effect on mobile browsers, so I have opted to not use it at all.

YMMV: Feel free to experiment with the property in your CSS. Flip Move will respect the wishes of your stylesheet :)
