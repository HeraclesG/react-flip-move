/**
 * React Flip Move
 * Automagically animate the transition when the DOM gets reordered.
 *
 * How it works:
 * The basic idea with this component is pretty straightforward:
 *
 *   - We track all rendered elements by their `key` property, and we keep
 *     their bounding boxes (their top/left/right/bottom coordinates) in this
 *     component's state.
 *   - When the component updates, we compare its former position (held in
 *     state) with its new position (derived from the DOM after update).
 *   - If the two have moved, we use the FLIP technique to animate the
 *     transition between their positions.
